# CAPL Scripting Basics â€“ Automotive Test Simulation

This section includes CAPL scripts created during my CANoe simulation learning phase.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| ToggleSignal_KeyPress.capl | Simulates key press triggering signal toggle |
| Heartbeat_Timer.capl | Sends a periodic heartbeat message to simulate ECU status |
| MessageRepeater_IDChange.capl | Repeats a CAN message with modified ID |
| FaultInjector.capl | Simulates faulty message for validation testing |

---

## What This Simulates in Real Life

These CAPL programs mimic real automotive test cases such as:
- Signal toggling during driver input
- ECU heartbeat validation in diagnostics
- Fault injection to test robustness of vehicle systems

---

## Validation Use Cases
Used in:
- HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulations
- Diagnostic automation
- Functional validation of vehicle ECUs

---

## Next Steps (In real world scenario)
- Connect to symbolic DBC signals
- Automate test pass/fail logic using CAPL timers
- Integrate with signal logging & Python validation script
