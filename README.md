# CANoe Simulation QuickStart Project (View-Only Mode) 

This project is a hands-on documentation series built by following **Vector's official CANoe Quick Start Guide**, reimagined to work under the limitations of the **View-Only License**.  
It demonstrates the **ability to simulate, document, and conceptualize automotive validation workflows even without full hardware access**.

---

## What This Project Covers

- Step-by-step learning aligned with CANoe Quick Start modules
- Practical simulation setup and configuration walkthroughs
- Interface exploration and symbolic decoding practices
- Transparent mapping of **View-Only Mode** restrictions vs full-license capabilities
- Basic CAN scripting using **CAPL (CANoe Programming Language)**
- Real-world automotive validation concepts and manual signal analysis

## Key Skills Practiced

- CAN Bus Network Configuration
- Symbolic Message Interpretation (DBC Usage)
- Raw Frame Transmission and Cyclic Messaging
- Logging, Trace Window Setup, Data Export
- CAPL Scripting (Key-Triggered, Timer-Triggered, Fault Injection, and Threshold Monitoring)
- Documentation in Engineering Format (Markdown + GitHub ready)
- Understanding Real-World Use Cases in HIL, EOL Testing, and Network Validation

## Highlights of this project

Even though **View-Only Mode** limits runtime execution, this project:

- **Mirrors actual engineering workflows**
- **Simulates professional validation scenarios** (e.g., Manual Frame Testing, Fault Injection, Signal Threshold Monitoring)
- **Practices manual message creation and signal tracking logic**
- **Documents step-by-step actions with screenshots** 
---

## Goal

To demonstrate strong **hands-on simulation planning**, **automotive communication protocol understanding**, and **problem-solving skills** by recreating CANoe workflows under licensing constraints â€” bridging theoretical learning and real-world application.

> *For full CAPL execution and bus simulation, a licensed CANoe environment would be needed.*
