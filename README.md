# CANoe Simulation QuickStart Project (View-Only Mode)

This project is based on Vector's official CANoe Quick Start Guide and documents key learning outcomes using the **View-Only License** of CANoe. It simulates the experience of working in a restricted environment while still enabling practical documentation, interface exploration, and basic scripting concepts.

---

## Each Section Contains

- Key learnings from the corresponding Quick Start module  
- Annotated screenshots of CANoe interface windows  
- Mock simulation ideas or scripting concepts (for practice)  
- Structured documentation in Markdown format  
- Transparent notes on View-Only Mode limitations vs licensed capabilities  

This project is especially helpful for learners who want to understand CANoe workflows **without needing a licensed setup**.

## Sections Included

###  Section 1 – Overview of CANoe  
###  Section 2 – Create a New Configuration  
###  Section 3 – Explore Interface Windows  
###  Section 4 – Set Up the Bus  
###  Section 5 – Transmit CAN Messages  
###  Section 6 – Work with Symbolic Data 

## Upcoming Sections (to be added)

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 7 | Analyze Signal Values in Data Window |
| 8 | Analyze Signal Responses in Graphics Window |
| 9 | Log a Measurement |
| 10 | Evaluate a Logging File |
| 11 | Create a CAPL Program |
| 12 | Simulate Distributed Systems in CANoe |

## Goal

To build confidence in CANoe simulation environments using just View-Only Mode — by documenting insights, interface logic, and exploring symbolic decoding techniques in a structured format.

 *For full simulation and CAPL execution, a licensed CANoe environment is required.*
