# Section10_Evaluate_Logging_File

This section builds upon the logging workflow from Section 9 by showcasing how **recorded log files** can be evaluated using **Offline Mode** in CANoe. It simulates a scenario where engineers review CAN traffic, signal behavior, and diagnostic data **after** a test run has been completed.

All actions were performed in **View-Only Mode**, meaning no live animation, CAPL execution, or interactive replay was possible. However, offline signals and measurement structure could still be explored and documented.

## What Was Done in View-Only Mode

While the system was in Offline Mode, the following steps from **Section 10.1 of the Quick Start Guide** were replicated:

### Activated Offline Mode  
Used the **Offline Mode** toggle and verified that bus sources were disabled and logging sources became active.

### Chose and Loaded the Data Source  
Opened the **Offline File List** and added `.blf` logs (`CANSystem_CAN1.blf` and `CANSystem_CAN2.blf`). These logs were parsed and shown in the Trace Window.

### Deactivated the Logging Branch  
Visually confirmed the action of separating the logging block via its hotspot (though actual editing wasnâ€™t enabled).

### Observed Playback Options  
Playback tools like `F9`, `Animate`, and `Step` were visible under the **Home ribbon**, but not usable.

### Signal Analysis in Offline Mode  
The trace and graphics windows still displayed signal streams from the offline logs. Symbols were automatically decoded from previously configured DBCs and data panels.

## What Could Have Been Done in Licensed Mode

The full license of CANoe would have enabled the following enhancements beyond what was viewable:

- **Animated Playback**: Replay `.blf` or `.asc` logs with real-time signal animation using the `Animate` button or `<F8>`.
- **Step Mode Replay**: Walk through events frame-by-frame using `<F7>` to analyze signal transitions.
- **CAPL-based Filters**: Apply or run CAPL scripts to trigger markers, filter logs, or highlight important events during playback.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Interactively filter messages or signals during analysis to isolate failures or verify test criteria.
- **Time Navigation Tools**: Use timeline cursor, bookmarks, and jump-to-event functions not available in View-Only mode.

## Summary

This section provided **hands-on familiarity with post-logging workflows** inside CANoe:

- Simulated log playback flow using `.blf` files
- Observed behavior of Offline Mode structure
- Reinforced concepts like deactivating live components and reviewing traces
- Built confidence in using CANoe as a post-simulation diagnostic and analysis tool
