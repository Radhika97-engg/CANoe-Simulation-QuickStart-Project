# Section 03: Interface Windows – Exploring the CANoe GUI

In this section, I explored key interface windows in Vector CANoe using View-Only Mode. Each panel serves a specific role in automotive validation, from controlling test scenarios to analyzing CAN messages in real time.

### Full Interface Overview
**Screenshot**: `interface_fullview.png`  
**Description**:  
This view showcases the entire CANoe interface with Simulation Tree, Control Panel, Trace Window, Graphics Window, and Write Panel. It provides a unified visualization of how automotive communication and testing is organized in CANoe.

**Description**:  
The control panel includes an ignition switch, brake pedal, gear selector, and accelerator input. These simulate basic driving conditions used in virtual validation.

### Graphics Panel – Signal Visualization
**Screenshot**: `graphics_panel_open.png`  
**Description**:  
This panel displays live signal data such as car speed, engine RPM, and gear shifts. It’s ideal for monitoring time-based changes and response behaviors during simulation.

### Trace Window – Raw CAN Data

**Screenshot**: `trace_window.png`  
**Description**:  
This window shows raw CAN frames: ID, data, direction, and timestamp. It’s commonly used for debugging and validating communication timing or content between nodes.

---

### Write Panel – System Logs

**Screenshot**: `write_window.png`  
**Description**:  
Logs all runtime messages and system status. Used to track CANoe actions such as file imports, measurement start/stop, or simulation issues.

---

### Node Panel – Engine ECU

**Screenshot**: `node_panel_powertrain_engine.png`  
**Description**:  
Displays message configuration for the Engine node under PowerTrain. Allows monitoring which signals are transmitted or received, and their update conditions.

**What I Learned:**
- Navigated all key panels and UI layouts in CANoe
- Understood the role of each window in simulating and debugging automotive networks
- Prepared a structured reference for future validation projects
